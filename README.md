# Predicting-Water-Potability-Using-ML
This project uses machine learning to predict water potability based on chemical properties such as pH, hardness, sulfate, and chloramines. It implements a full ML pipeline including preprocessing, EDA, model training (Logistic Regression, kNN, Random Forest), tuning, and evaluation to support water quality assessment.
